<h1>Hello World from your own copy of Agile Toolkit</h1>
<p>Welcome to Agile Toolkit. You are few steps away from starting building your own Web Software compatible
with jQuery UI CSS Framework.</p>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>
<p>This page have been generated by Agile Toolkit from the template located in templates/jui/page/index.html through the page class in page/index.php and API class located in lib/Frontend.php. While most of this text is located inside the template file for faster parsing and flexibility, some dynamic elements are added from the page class.
